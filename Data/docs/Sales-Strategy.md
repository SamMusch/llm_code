**Sales Maximization Strategy**

1. **Country focus**

   * Prioritize Spain and Canada first; expand next into Saudi Arabia and India.
   * Deprioritize Mexico and Germany until traction appears.
   * Sequence rollout: pilot in Spain → replicate in Canada → localize for Saudi Arabia/India.

2. **Product focus**

   * Lead with Wines and Meat as anchor categories.
   * Bundle secondary products (Gold, Fish, Fruits, Sweet) with anchor products.
   * Use cross-category promotions instead of single-item discounts.

3. **Customer marital status**

   * Target Married and Together segments with bulk, premium, and recurring offers.
   * Use Single segment for smaller packs and trial bundles.
   * Minimize spend on “Others” until clearer response emerges.

4. **Recency management**

   * Identify recent purchasers and trigger immediate follow-up offers.
   * Re-engage lapsed customers with limited-time product bundles.
   * Sequence actions: purchase → reminder → incentive → escalation.

5. **Current vs previous year comparison**

   * Scale countries and products showing year-over-year growth.
   * Pause investment where declines persist; test alternative product mixes.
   * Use growth areas as templates for weaker segments.

6. **Product × country alignment**

   * Match top-performing products to their strongest countries.
   * Avoid uniform global campaigns; localize product emphasis by country.
   * Reallocate inventory based on country-product fit.

7. **Customer concentration**

   * Focus acquisition where customer density already exists.
   * Use lookalike targeting based on dominant countries and marital groups.
   * Expand only after saturation signals appear.

**Outcome**
Concentrated execution by country, product, marital status, and recency increases conversion efficiency, repeat purchases, and scalable growth without adding new metrics.
